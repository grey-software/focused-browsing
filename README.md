## Project Status
---
This project is currently being maintained by [Arsala](https://gitlab.com/ArsalaBangash), [Avi](https://gitlab.com/daveavi), and [Raj](https://gitlab.com/teccUI).

## Features
---
### Show & Hide distractions without leaving the tab you're on.
<br/>

We want to empower you to be able to focus when you want to, but we also don't want to make it tedious for you when you want to browse what's happening on the Internet.

That is why we made it easy for you to hide and bring back feeds without leaving your tab.

### Control Distractions using keyboard shortcuts
<br/>

We added keyboard shortcuts to make it seamless and intuitive for you to toggle distractions on our supported websites. 

Command/Ctrl+Shift+1 currently toggles all distractions and we are thinking of other shortcuts to help optimize & personalize your experience. 

### The websites that are important to you are on our roadmap
<br/>

We currently support Twitter, and we have our eyes set on LinkedIn, Facebook, and Youtube next. If you would like us to support a website that is distracting you, let us know on our [Github discussion board](https://github.com/grey-software/focused-browsing/discussions).

## The Story
---

Professionals and creators on the Internet are drowning in information.

This hinders them from doing their best work because their ability to focus is affected by the content and news on their feed.

Currently, platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter do not allow their users to hide their news and content feeds.

But what if we offered them a way to regain control over the feeds they did or did not want to consume?

Other extensions on the market were helpful but lacked the kind of user experience our team was looking for.

That's why we're building Focused Browsing!
